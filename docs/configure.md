# Configure DC/OS Vagrant

The number of machines and their resources is configurable, depending on your needs and hardware constraints.

The [VagrantConfig.yaml.example](/VagrantConfig.yaml.example) includes some preset machine configurations that have been chosen to allow the widest possible use cases within a constrained memory environment (e.g. a laptop with 16GB memory). These presets may or may not fit your use case. If they don't, just modify your `VagrantConfig.yaml` file to fit your needs.

Deploying multiple VMs takes a lot of memory and Mesos reserves more for overhead on each node. So don't expect to be able to install every DC/OS service or use production-grade configurations. Most services will require reduced configurations in order to fit within the allocated memory. Some services (e.g. Cassandra) may require more nodes/resources than others.

For more information about how the DC/OS installation works and how to debug deployment/installation failure, see [DC/OS Install Process](/docs/dcos-install-process.md).

## Node Types

Each machine in `VagrantConfig.yaml` must specify one of the following node types that governs how that machine will be provisioned:

- `master` - Master node that runs the DC/OS core components (e.g. `m1`)
- `agent-private` - Agent node that runs the Mesos agent with the `*` role (e.g. `a1`)
- `agent-public` - Agent node that runs the Mesos agent with the `slave_public` role (e.g. `p1`)
- `boot` - Bootstrap node that runs the installer (e.g. `boot`)

## Cluster Constraints

Which exact machines are created and provisioned can be specified in one of two ways:

1. Specify the machines by name when deploying (e.g. `vagrant up m1 a1 p1 boot`)
1. Remove the unwanted machines from the `VagrantConfig.yaml` file and deploy them all with `vagrant up`

Generally option 1 is recommended to avoid having to modify the `VagrantConfig.yaml` file.

When selecting which machines to deploy, the following constraints must be observed:

- An odd number of master nodes is required (usually 1, 3, or 5)
- Any number of public and/or private agent nodes is allowed
- Exactly one bootstrap node is required
- The bootstrap node must be provisioned last

## Resource Constraints

DC/OS services will be installed on Mesos agent nodes. Mesos will auto-detect the amount of resources available on these machines, with the following constraint:

- Mesos reserves half or 1 GB of each machine's memory for overhead (whichever is least)

For example, `m1` has 3328 MB memory by default. Some of that memory will be taken by OS and DC/OS component processes (~ MB). 1 GB will be reserved by Mesos as overhead. The rest will be offered to Mesos frameworks for launching tasks (~ MB).

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure your local machine has enough memory to launch all your desired VMs, otherwise your machine may lock up as all the memory is consumed.


# Environment Options

There are several configurable options when deploying a cluster and installing DC/OS on it. Most of them are configurable via environment variables:

- `DCOS_BOX` - VirtualBox box image name (default: `mesosphere/dcos-centos-virtualbox`)
- `DCOS_BOX_URL` - VirtualBox box image url or vagrant-cloud style image repo (default: `https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos-vagrant/metadata.json`)
- `DCOS_BOX_VERSION` - VirtualBox box image version (default: `~> 0.5.0`)
- `DCOS_MACHINE_CONFIG_PATH` - Path to virtual machine configuration manifest (default: `VagrantConfig.yaml`)
    - Must contain at least one `boot` type machine, one `master` type machine, and one `agent` or `agent-public` type machine.
- `DCOS_GENERATE_CONFIG_PATH` - Path to DC/OS configuration generation script (default: `dcos_generate_config.sh`)
- `DCOS_INSTALL_METHOD` - One of the following [installation methods](/docs/alternate-install-methods.md) (default: `ssh_pull`):
    - `ssh_pull` - Use the "manual" DC/OS installation method (`dcos_install.sh`) with a pool of thread workers performing remote SHH installation.
    - `ssh_push` - Use the "automated" DC/OS installation method (`dcos_generate_config.sh --deploy`). WARNING: Does not (yet) support agent-public nodes!
    - `web` - Use the GUI DC/OS installation method (`dcos_generate_config.sh --web`). WARNING: Does not (yet) support agent-public nodes!
- `DCOS_PRIVATE_REGISTRY` - Boolean to install an insecure private Docker registry on the boot machine and configure the agents to allow it (default: `false`)
- `DCOS_VAGRANT_MOUNT_METHOD` - One of the following methods (default: `virtualbox`):
    - `virtualbox` - Use cross-platform [VirtualBox shared folders](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/virtualbox.html)
    - `nfs` - Use faster [NFS shared folders](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/nfs.html).

Additional advanced configuration may be possible by modifying the Vagrantfile directly, but is not encouraged because the internal APIs may change at any time.
